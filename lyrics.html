        Through the gates of hell
        As we make our way to heaven
        Through the Nazi lines
        Primo victoria
        
        We've been training for years
        Now we're ready to strike
        As the great operation begins
        We're the first wave on the shore
        We're the first ones to fall
        Yet soldiers have fallen before
        
        In the dawn they will pay
        With their lives as the price
        History's written today
        In this burning inferno
        Know that nothing remains
        As our forces advance on the beach
        
        Aiming for heaven though serving in hell
        Victory is ours their forces will fall
        
        Through the gates of hell
        As we make our way to heaven
        Through the Nazi lines
        Primo victoria
        
        On the 6th of June
        On the shores of western Europe 1944
        D-day upon us
        
        We've been here before
        Used to this kind of war
        Crossfire grind through the sand
        Our orders were easy
        It's kill or be killed
        Blood on both sides will be spilled
        
        In the dawn they will pay
        With their lives as the price
        History's written today
        Now that we are at war
        With the axis again
        This time we know what will come
        
        Aiming for heaven though serving in hell
        Victory is ours their forces will fall
        
        Through the gates of hell
        As we make our way to heaven
        Through the Nazi lines

        6th of June 1944
        Allies are turning the war
        Normandy state of anarchy
        Overlord
        
        Aiming for heaven though serving in hell
        Victory is ours their forces will fall

            A cry for help, a distant whisper
            A foreign nation calling our name
            Sent to hell, to reach for heaven
            To serve in dark, as light in the black
            
            Sent into battle to aid strangers in need
            Gain independence, our forces will lead
            Final solution when all others have failed
            Liberation is coming our path has been laid
            
            We remember the fields, where our tanks held the line
            We remember our brothers in arms
            
            When the war, has been won
            And our march home begins
            What awaits has not yet been revealed
            What was won? what was lost?
            Will our deeds be remembered?
            Are they written on stone or in sand?
            
            Marching ashore, our target awaits
            Facing resistance, forces driven by hate
            Protecting civilians, while fired upon
            Rules of engagement, our restrictions are gone
            
            We remember the sea, where our ships broke the waves
            We remember our brothers in arms
            
            Leaving home, set to sea
            Was this really meant to be?
            See the shore of our home fade away
            Facing blood, facing pain
            Have our brothers died in vain?
            Many lives has been lost on the way

            Under this sun no shadows will fall
            Piercing our eyes as we charge
            An armoured battalion on course to the east
            Closing the end of it's march

            This time we're here to finish a job
            Started a decade ago
            Driving the animals out of their holes
            To bury them 6 feet below
            Armoured tanks of mass destruction
            Killers in the east
            Rats who dares to stand before us
            Feel our guns go live

            Death in the shape of a panzer battalion
            Insect of terror don't run face your fate like a
            Man cannot outrun our panzer battalion

            Thousands of tons of armour and guns
            Making it's way through the sand
            Our panzer battalion is back for revenge
            Artillery sweeping the land

            First strike is ours no mercy is shown
            There's rivers of blood in our track
            Breaking their waves of defence with our tanks
            Infantry watching our back

            Blow their SAM sites clear for air strike
            Ready for the storm
            Minefields swept there's no surrender
            Feel our napalm burn

            Accused of treason by his own
            Sentenced by countrymen under pressure of foreign influence
            Men he once fought to free

            When the new meets the old

            Oh, I remember the silence
            On a cold winter day
            After many months on the battlefield
            And we were used to the violence
            Then all the cannons went silent
            And the snow fell
            Voices sang to me from no man's land
            
            We are all, we are all, we are all, we are all friends
            
            And today we're all brothers, tonight we're all friends
            A moment of peace in a war that never ends
            Today we're all brothers, we drink and unite
            Now Christmas has arrived and the snow turns the ground white
            Hear carols from the trenches, we sing O Holy Night
            Our guns laid to rest among snowflakes

            Heard a hundred miles away
            A million shells were fired
            And the green fields turned to grey
            The bombardment lasted all day long
            Yet the forts were standing strong
            Heavily defended
            Now the trap's been sprung
            And the battle's begun

            No one has the upper hand
            From the ground above to trenches
            Where the soldiers make their stand
            As the trenches slowly turn to mud
            And then quickly start to flood
            Death awaits in every corner
            As they die in the mud

            Fields of Verdun
            
            Fields of execution turned to wasteland from the grass
            Thou shalt go no further. It was said, "They shall not pass!"
            The spirit of resistance and the madness of the war
            So go ahead!
            Face the lead!
            Join the dead!
            Though you die!
